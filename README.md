# Other traversing methods

### Challenge 1

When a colored panel is clicked, all panels vanish (this part of the challenge will be committed in button.html)

### part two of the challenge:
When a colored panel is clicked, just that panel disappears (gave it a class makeWhite)

When a panel is clicked, all siblings fade to 10% opacity (fadeTo on all siblings within panel)

When reset is clicked, all panels revert to full opacity (all the remaining panels go back to full opacity)

When the mouse hovers over a panel, that panel turns black (mouseenter and mouseout and in 10% opacity it gives 10% black when hovered)

When the mouse moves away, the panel reverts back to its previous colour (the mouseout)

A tricky challenge where I learned a lot.
